# Mini Project 1 – Basics of NLP: Text Cleaning & Vectorization

## Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by applying text preprocessing and vectorization techniques on customer reviews.  
The objective is to prepare text data for **sentiment classification** (positive, negative, or neutral), which is highly useful for e-commerce platforms to monitor customer feedback.

## Features
- Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, special characters, etc.)
- Tokenization and normalization
- Vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF, etc.)
- Dataset preprocessing for sentiment analysis

## Repository Structure
- `Mini Project 1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with complete workflow  
- `dataset.csv` (or your dataset file) → raw customer reviews dataset  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK  

## Use Case
Helps businesses automatically classify customer sentiment and extract insights from large volumes of reviews.  
This can improve customer experience, reduce churn, and enhance decision-making.
